# Simple Genetic Algorithm

A simple genetic algorithm that uses crossover and mutation to solve the *onemax* problem.

In evolutionary computation, the *onemax problem* is where to evolve binary strings by maximizing the amount of 1's in each string.

For example, given a set of binary strings of length 5, the goal is to evolve strings that look like `11111`, where each possible position contains a 1.
